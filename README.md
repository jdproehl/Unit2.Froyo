# Unit2.Froyo
Unit 2 | Block 15 Workshop: Froyo Assignment

There is no starter code for this workshop; the solutions to previous workshops will be great to review!

1. Create a new repository named Unit2.Froyo on GitHub and clone it down.
2. Add your cohort team to the repository you just made.
3. Open the project with VS Code and create an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
4. Figure out a plan for what code you'll need to write based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.

Rubric Requirements: 
1. Project Management 
   The latest changes have been pushed to the submitted Github repo.

4. Functionality (!)
   The user's input string is split into an array of strings.
5. Functionality

7. Functionality (!)
   The program correctly counts the number of each flavor in the user's input.
8. Code Style
